# BOE_wordlist_checker
I made this small code for looking automatically on the BOE, searching for words in a list (like: scholarships...).
Using UBUNTU is possible to automatically run a command in the shell when it the system starts up. In this way it writes a report about what it has found and pops up a notification.

The file structure from where it reads may not be clear...sorry about that.
